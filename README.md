# Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.

The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistics with the rise of computers.

The problem of understanding text is not solved, and may never be, is primarily because language is messy. There are few rules. And yet we can easily understand each other most of the time.
